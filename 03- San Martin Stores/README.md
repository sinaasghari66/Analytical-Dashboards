# San Martin Stores

"This analysis dashboard is developed based on one of the dashboards created by Mr. Rico Balibalita. In this dashboard, I tried to take a new look at the data and improve his design. The information in this dashboard pertains to January 2021 for a chain store.

You can access the interactive version without needing to install Power BI via this [link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTAyNzU3MmUtZWJhMy00ODA0LWExNjQtOGE2ZmE1OWMyZTk4IiwidCI6IjQ0ODI2YzYyLTA3MWEtNDY0YS05ZjA2LTk5ZmFlN2IwZDY2ZiIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D).

## Data Model

The source file was an Excel file, and the final data model was transformed into a star schema using Power Query capabilities.
In designing this, some of the visuals make use of the Power BI parameter feature. Additionally, more than 60 measures have been defined in this dashboard.

## Analysis

The analyses are divided into four main categories:
1. **Geographical Analysis**
2. **Metrics Correlation Analysis**
3. **Products Analysis**
4. **Agents Analysis**
5. **Customers Analysis**

## UI Design

The user interface and all buttons were designed in Figma. Additionally.


Feel free to explore the dashboard and gain insights from the data.
